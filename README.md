Welcome to my `Sorting Visualizer` project! The goal of the project was to create a frontend application that visualizes the different steps of sorting algorithms. Through this visualizer, users can interactively explore and understand the functioning of various sorting algorithms by visualizing the sorting process of random data in real-time. This project provides insight into the efficiency and performance of different sorting algorithms.

You can see the application in action and try out different sorting algorithms by checking out the [live demo](https://kecioch.github.io/sorting-visualizer).
